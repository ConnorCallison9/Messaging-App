Project Description:
As part of a Computer Networks course, our team was tasked with designing and implementing a functional messaging application. The application was developed in Visual Studio using the .NET framework. 
Our responsibilities included creating two distinct server types: a peer-to-peer server for direct communication and a group server for managing group interactions. 
This required effective collaboration and division of responsibilities among team members.
